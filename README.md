# Car Classification using ResNet-18 on the CompCars Dataset

A deep learning project for classifying car manufacturers from surveillance camera images using convolutional neural networks.

## üîç Overview

This project tackles the challenging task of fine-grained car manufacturer classification from surveillance camera images. Unlike web-based car images, surveillance footage presents unique challenges including poor lighting conditions, occlusions, varying viewing angles, and low resolution.

The solution employs ResNet-18 architecture with specialized techniques to handle class imbalance and improve classification performance on underrepresented car brands.

## üìä Dataset

**CompCars Dataset - Surveillance Subset**
- **67 car manufacturers**
- **Surveillance camera images** captured under real-world conditions
- **Severe class imbalance**: Range from 12 samples (Infiniti) to 2,526 samples (Volkswagen)
- **Challenging conditions**: Blur, extreme lighting, occlusions, limited feature visibility

### Data Preprocessing
- Image resizing to 224√ó224 pixels
- RGB normalization using ImageNet statistics
- Targeted data augmentation for underrepresented classes (<500 samples)
- Standard train/validation/test split

### Key Improvements
- **Focal Loss + Augmentation**: +4-5% accuracy improvement
- **Class Balance**: Better performance on minority classes
- **Generalization**: Strong performance on unseen surveillance images

### Common Misclassifications
- Similar-looking brands (BMW vs Mercedes-Benz)
- Poor lighting conditions
- Heavy occlusions
- Extreme viewing angles
